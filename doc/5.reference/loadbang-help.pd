#X text 39 112 The loadbang object outputs a 'bang' message when the
containing patch is opened as a document or included in another patch
as an abstraction. Loadbangs inside abstractions send their "bang"
messages before those of loadbangs in the calling patch. Otherwise
\, the order in which the "bangs" are sent from two loadbang objects
is undefined., f 51;

#X text 39 227 The initbang object sends a 'bang' message even before
at initialization time. It can be used in an abstraction to initialize
it before the calling patch is loaded \, which is needed to initialize
the abstraction with variable number of inlets/outlets using dynamic
patching., f 51;
#X text 451 108 The initbang and closebang objects are used inside
the abstraction called 'load-abstraction'., f 50;
#X text 451 26 Conversely \, the closebang object sends a 'bang' message
when an abstraction is getting deleted. For instance \, you can use
this to cleanup the patch and do other things you have to do when it
gets deleted., f 50;
