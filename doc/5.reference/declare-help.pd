#X text 52 51 A declare object adds one or more directories to the
search path \, and/or pre-loads one or more libraries ("extensions")
to Pd in preparation for opening the patch from a file. Usage is "declare
[-flag value] [-flag value] ..." where the flag can be:, f 70;
#X text 24 166 -lib;
#X text 24 187 -stdlib;
#X text 24 131 -path;
#X text 24 149 -stdpath;
#X text 30 541 BUG: The name "-stdpath" is confusing \, as it has a
quite different effect from "-stdpath" on the pd command line.;
#X text 30 299 For instance \, if you put abstractions and/or other
supporting files in a subdirectory "more" \, you can put an object
\, "declare -path more" to make sure Pd sees them when the patch is
loaded. Or \, if you have files installed in the directory extra/stillmore
(in the Pd installation) you can get it using "declare -stdpath stillmore".
, f 70;
#X text 30 380 WARNING: as of version 0.47 \, "declare -path" and "declare
-stdpath" inside abstractions take effect only within those abstractions.
If Pd's compatibility version is set to 0.46 or earlier the old (buggy)
behavior takes effect., f 70;
#X text 31 256 (For any of these you may use a full pathname such as
"/tmp/dir" or \, in Windows \, "C:/garbage" instead of a relative path).

#X text 29 456 As of verion 0.48-2 \, "declare -path" and "declare
-lib" will fall back to user search paths if the relative path to the
patch does not exit. Then \, lastly \, it'll also fall back to the
"extra" folder. To avoid checking elsewhere look for stuff only related
to the patch \, use an explicit relative path by prepending "./" to
the path or lib name., f 70;
