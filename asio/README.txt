In order to build ASIO support into Pd on Windows, you need to download the
ASIO sources from Steinberg directly.  Their license does not let us
redistribute their source files.

- Download the ASIO SDK https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html
- Uncompress asiosdk2.3.zip into /asio
- the ASIO source files should end up in /asio/ASIOSDK2.3
